Burning Meme Smart Contracts
Welcome to the Burning Meme project's official repository for smart contracts! This project aims to create a unique and engaging experience for users to mint, burn, and interact with NFTs and memecoins.

Overview
Burning Meme is a memecoin launchpad that enables users to create, mint, and burn memes as NFTs. Our smart contracts are designed to facilitate these actions and ensure a seamless experience for users. The project is built on the principles of transparency, security, and community involvement.

Features
Minting NFTs: Users can mint NFTs by mixing burning mascots and memes.
Burning NFTs: Users can burn their NFTs to participate in various activities and earn points.
Airdrops: Participants qualify for airdrops based on their activity and engagement.
Leaderboard: Track your progress and see how you rank against other participants.
